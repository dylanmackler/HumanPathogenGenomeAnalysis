**About me**

I’m a senior biology student at UMass Amherst interested in scientific data communications. My work in biotechnology and healthcare communication has helped shape complex biological insights into clear, data-driven interpretations that inform research and business decisions. I’m pursuing a career in biotech or healthcare consulting, where I can connect scientific innovation with real-world medical and patient impact.
